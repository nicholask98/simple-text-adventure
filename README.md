# simple-text-adventure
 
This is a basic version of the Adventure game. It is completely text-based. In this version of the game, users can move about through different rooms within a single setting, and based on the user input, it will provide descriptions for each room.

Movement direction is crucial here â€“ you must create walls and set the directions in which the users can move through the rooms, set movement restrictions, and also include a tracker that can track how far a user has walked or moved in the game. 

### Self-imposed restrictions:
- game will have 12 rooms total
- there will be one key hidden in one of the rooms
- the key will unlock the door to the exit to win
